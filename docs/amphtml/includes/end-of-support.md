> The developer preview of AMP for Email will end on October 1, 2020. After that date, AMP for Email will be turned off in Outlook.com. Emails that used AMP will instead render using regular HTML. There is no action email senders need to take for this fallback to work automatically. If email senders want to send dynamic emails to Outlook users, we encourage you to leverage [Actionable Messages](../../actionable-messages/index.md) instead. See the [announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/developer-preview-of-amp-for-email-in-outlook-com-no-longer/ba-p/821020) on the Outlook blog for more information.
