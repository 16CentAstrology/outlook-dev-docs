# Supported Outlook versions

During preview, AMP for Email is only supported in the **web version** (browser-based) of **Outlook.com** for **personal accounts**. Additionally, only about half of users mailboxes have the feature turned on by default. This is because we are evaluating the impact of the feature before making a decision to roll it out to all users and other versions of Outlook.

## Supported desktop browsers

Outlook uses modern browser technology to render AMP for email. Unsupported browsers fall back to the HTML version of the email.

| Browser | Minimum version|
|-------|-----|
| Edge  | 77.0.223 (Chromium based) |
| Chrome  | 69 |
| Firefox  | 58 |
| Opera  | 48 |
| Safari  | 10 |
| Internet Explorer| Not supported |

Mobile browsers are currently not supported.
