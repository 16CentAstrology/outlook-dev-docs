# Sender Registration
The email address AMP emails originate from must be registered with Outlook to render AMP emails. If the address is not registered the AMP part will be ignored and the HTML version of the email will be rendered instead. There are two mechanisms to register an address with Outlook.

## Individual Mailbox registration
During development, you can self-register to test AMP emails on your account. Follow these steps:

1. [Login](https://www.outlook.com) to you outlook.com account
1. Go to `Settings>All Outlook settings>Dynamic Email`
1. Ensure that dynamic email is turned on
1. Add any sender email addresses that you will use during your testing
