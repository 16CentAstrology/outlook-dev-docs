# Get Started with AMP for Email

## Author AMP for Email code

1. Read the [AMP for Email specification](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format) to understand the fundamentals. 
1. If this is the first time you create an AMP email we recommend you to start with this [Tutorial](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create_email/?format=email)
1. Develop your code using [AMP Components](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/?format=email) and test using the [AMP Playground](https://playground.amp.dev/?runtime=amp4email). 


## Test AMP emails in Outlook.com
When developing AMP emails, you can use your own Outlook.com account to test them. 

1. Register the sender address with Outlook. During development you can self-register. See [details](register-outlook.md)
1. Send AMP email to your Outlook.com mailbox. 
    - Use this simple sender tool [Add link to tool when ready].
    - You can also use any other tool or service provider that supports AMP for email. See [more](https://amp.dev/documentation/tools/)

## Send emails to Outlook.com users

Once you are ready to send emails to Outlook.com end users (your actual customers) you must [register to become an authorized sender](register-outlook.md). 

Once approved, Outlook.com users that have the feature turned on, about half of Outlook.com users during the preview, will see the AMP version of your emails.
