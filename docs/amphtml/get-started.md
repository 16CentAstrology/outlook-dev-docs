# Get Started with AMP for Email

## Author AMP for Email code

1. Read the [AMP for Email specification](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format) to understand the fundamentals.
1. If this is your first time creating an AMP email we recommend you to start with this [tutorial](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create_email/?format=email)
1. Develop your code using [AMP Components](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/?format=email) and test using the [AMP Playground](https://playground.amp.dev/?runtime=amp4email).

## Test AMP emails in Outlook.com

When developing AMP emails, you can use your own Outlook.com account to test them.

1. [Register the sender address](register-outlook.md) with Outlook. During development you can self-register.
1. Send AMP email to your Outlook.com mailbox.
    - Use this simple sender tool [Add link to tool when ready].
    - You can also use any other tool or service provider that supports AMP for email. See the [AMP Tools page](https://amp.dev/documentation/tools/) for a list of tools.

## Send emails to Outlook.com users

Once you are ready to send emails to Outlook.com end users (your actual customers), you must [register to become an authorized sender](register-outlook.md). Once approved, Outlook.com users that have the feature turned on, about half of Outlook.com users during the preview, will see the AMP version of your emails.
