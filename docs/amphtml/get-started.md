# Get Started with AMP for Email

## Author AMP for Email code

1. Read the [AMP for Email specification](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format) to understand the fundamentals. 
1. If this is the first time you create an AMP email we recommend you to start with this [Tutorial](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create_email/?format=email)
1. Develop your code using [AMP Components](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/?format=email) and test using the [AMP Playground](https://playground.amp.dev/?runtime=amp4email). 

If you already created an AMP email that works in another email provider you can skip to the next step. Your email should work "as is"

## Test AMP emails in Outlook.com
When developing AMP emails, you can use your own Outlook.com account to test them. 

1. Register the sender address with Outlook. During development you can self-register. See [details](register-outlook.md)
1. Send AMP email to your Outlook.com mailbox via an ESP that supports the format such as [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/blog/mailgun-supports-amp-email), [AWeber](https://help.aweber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025741194-Getting-Started-with-AMP-for-Email-in-AWeber), [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/user-guide/amp-for-email/) and others.  See [more](https://amp.dev/documentation/tools/)

## Send emails to Outlook.com users

Once you are ready to send emails to Outlook.com end users (your actual customers) you must [register to become an authorized sender](register-outlook.md).
