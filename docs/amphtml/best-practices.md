# AMP for Email best practices

## AMP specific best practices

- Design your email to truly leverage the power of AMP. Deliver value by providing up-to-date information whenever possible and in-situ email interaction that keeps your users engaged and allows them to be as efficient as possible.
- Ensure you ALWAYS provide fallback HTML versions of your email
- Test your AMP emails with multiple email providers; the same emails should work across all of them.
