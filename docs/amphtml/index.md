# AMP for Email in Outlook.com (Preview)

[AMP for Email](https://amp.dev/about/email.html) is a new open source e-mail format that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive emails, almost like mini applications. These experiences make users more efficient by providing up-to-date information and actions that can be taken without switching to another application, reducing the burden of context switches.
