# AMP for Email in Outlook.com (Preview)

[AMP for Email](https://amp.dev/about/email.html) is a new open source email format that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive emails. These experiences make users more efficient by providing up-to-date information and actions that can be taken directly on email, reducing context switches.

## Preview Details

Outlook.com supports AMP for email as a preview. During the preview:

- Developers will be able to test AMPHTML emails on their own mailboxes
- Authorized senders will be able to send AMPHTML emails to users
- Only the Outlook.com web application will render AMPHTML emails. Other Outlook clients and platforms are not currently supported. 
- About half of Outlook.com users will have the feature turned on by default, allowing them to see AMP emails from authorized senders.  

## Your feedback is important
We will closely monitor the interest and feedback from Outlook users, developers and the email ecosystem during this preview. You can [reach out to us via email](mailto:ampforemailoutlook@service.microsoft.com). 

Also note that there are multiple technologies that enable the creation of dynamic and interactive emails. [Actionable messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/) is Outlook's officially supported format to create interactive email experiences. AMP for email is a new email format that we are evaluating.
