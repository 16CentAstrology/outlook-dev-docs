# AMP for Email in Outlook.com (Preview)

[AMP for Email](https://amp.dev/about/email.html) is a new open source e-mail format that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive emails, almost like mini applications. These experiences make users more efficient by providing up-to-date information and actions that can be taken without switching to another application, reducing the burden of context switches. 

> [!NOTE]
> There are various technologies that enable the creation of dynamic and interactive emails. [Actionable messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/) is the officially supported format across all Outlook clients to create interactive email experiences. AMP for email, is a new email format, and only the web version of Outlook.com will display AMP emails from authorized senders during preview.

## Preview Details

Outlook.com supports AMP for email as a preview. During the preview period:

- Only the Outlook.com web application will render AMPHTML emails. Other outlook clients and platforms are not currently supported. About half of Outlook.com users will have the feature turned on during the preview.
